\section{Model the coupled problem with the finite element method}
\subsection{Finite Element Formulation}
The problem essentially is solved coupling the two equations: first must be solved the electric problem and then the thermal problem; the link between the two equations is the term $ Q = J\cdot E=\sigma(\nabla U)^2. $ 

\subsection{Algorithm of the Finite Element Formulation for the Coupled Problem}
\begin{mdframed}
	The algorithm goes as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Discretize the domain and build the mesh.
		\item For each element $ e $ of the domain solve the electrical part as in the program \texttt{main2.m}
		\item With the value obtained from the electric problem extract for each element the heat $ Q $.
		\item Solve the thermal problem using the non constant value $ Q $ for each element.
	\end{itemize}
