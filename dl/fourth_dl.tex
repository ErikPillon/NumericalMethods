\section{Model the Electrical Problem with the Finite Elements Method}
\subsection{Study Domain and Mesh}
In this part we will study the electric part of the problem with the finite elements method. As usual first we will give the domain in which we investigate the problem, then a numerical scheme for the discretization of the domain is given and at the end we will implement the finite elements method.

\label{sec:5.1}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\begin{minipage}[c]{.5\linewidth}
		Since the domain of interest of the electric problem is larger than the thermal problem, we have to slightly modify our algorithm. We then have the algorithm in Listing \ref{points_electric}, where we have put in input of our function \texttt{mesh electric} the number of points in which we want to discretize our domain. In Fig.~ is painted the domanin of interest for this part of the problem.

The two followings algorithm are very similar to the ones given in section \ref{sec:4.1} for the thermal part, but we have to add to more points due to the domain constraints that now is larger.

\subsection{Galerkinâ€™s Formulation of the Electrical Equation}
The projection of the partial differential equation on a basis element is
\[\iiint_{\omega} \alpha_i \nabla\cdot(-\sigma\nabla U)\diff\Omega=0, \quad \forall i \]
and then the \textbf{weak formulation for the electric part} becomes
\begin{equation}
\iiint_{\omega}\sigma\alpha_i\cdot\nabla U\diff \Omega=0,\quad \forall i.
\end{equation}
The boundary conditions given can be modelized in the following fashion
\[\begin{cases}
U = 0, &\text{on the top of the crucible,}\\
U = U_0, &\text{on the bottom of the crucible,}\\
J\cdot n=0, &\text{on all the other surfaces.}
\end{cases} \]
As before, the elementary element of surface and volume are given by the canonical change of variables, from cartesian to cylindrical, i.e., \begin{align}\label{change2}
(x,y,z)&\to(r,\theta,z)\\
(x,y,z)&\mapsto(rcos(\theta),rsin(\theta),z)\nonumber
\end{align}
The change of variable given by Eq.\ref{change2} gives as determinant of the Jacobian matrix the element $ r $, in such a way that the integration must be performed changing $ \diff x\diff y\diff z $ into $ r\diff r\diff\theta\diff z $.

The second change of variables will be 
\begin{align}\label{change3}
(r,\theta,z)&\to(\xi,\eta)\\
(r,\theta,z)&\mapsto(\xi(r,z),\eta(r,z))\nonumber
\end{align}
and we will have $ dxdydz=det(Jac)d\xi d\eta $.
\subsection{Algorithm of the Finite Element Formulation of the Electrical Equation}
\begin{mdframed}
	The algorithm goes as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Discretize the domain and build the mesh.
		\item For each element $ e $ of the domain:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Construct the Jacobian matrix $ Jac $ with the functions $ \alpha_i $
			\item Evaluate the Jacobian $ \det(Jac) $
			\item Evaluate all the 16 terms $ \nabla\alpha_i\nabla\alpha_j $ with the help of the Gauss quadrature formula.
			\item Update the global matrix $ A $ with the function \texttt{Update}
		\end{itemize}
		\item For each element $ f $ of the upper boundary:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Construct the Jacobian $ Jac $ (that is already a scalar value) with the functions $ \alpha_1 $ and $ \alpha_2 $
			\item Evaluate all the 4 terms $ \alpha_i\alpha_j $ with the help of the 1D Gauss quadrature formula.
			\item Update the global matrix $ B $ with the function \texttt{Update} modified for the boundary elements
		\end{itemize}
		\item Solve the linear problem $ (A_{ij}+B_{ij})U_i = rhs $
	\end{itemize}
\end{mdframed}


In the program we make use of the following functions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{jacobian(M, Elem, e)} where \texttt{M} is the coordinates matrix and \texttt{Elem} is the mesh matrix, while \texttt{e} is the global element taken into consideration.
	\item \texttt{alpha(xi,eta)} where \texttt{xi,eta} are the local coordinates.
	\item \texttt{update} for updating the global matrix with the 16 values obtained for each element $ e $. 
	\item The functions \texttt{points\_electric} and \texttt{mesh} as already stated in Section \ref{sec:5.1} in Listing~\ref{points_electric} and Listing~\ref{mesh_electric} 
	\item The function \texttt{Update\_electric} for putting the values of the local matrix of each element $ e $ (resp. $ f $) in the global matrix $ A $ (resp. $ B $).
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Programming and calculation}
\subsubsection{Construct the program: main program and functions}

Where we used the function \texttt{jacobian} and \texttt{alpha} listed below.

\lstinputlisting[label={jacobian_electric},caption={Function for the creation of the jacobian matrix for each element}]{Matlab_Code/jacobian.m}

The function \texttt{alpha} is used for the creation of the alpha functions $ \alpha_i $ which will be used as the element basis of the local elements. This function is exactly the same we used for the thermal problem.
\lstinputlisting[label={alpha},caption={Function for the creation of the alpha functions and the derivatives of the latter}]{Matlab_Code/alpha.m}

The function \ref{update} is used for updating the global matrix with the values evaluated for each element of the domain and properly put in position $ (i,j) $.
